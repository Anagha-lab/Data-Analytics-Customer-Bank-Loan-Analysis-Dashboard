This project involved analyzing customer bank loan data to provide insights into loan status, payment behavior, and customer demographics. An interactive dashboard was created to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) such as state-wise loan status, year-wise loan amount statistics, verified vs. non-verified payment status, and home ownership trends. The dashboard helped financial institutions make informed decisions about loan approvals, risk assessment, and customer engagement strategies
